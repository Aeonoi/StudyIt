## Goals (May change):

### Dashboard: 

* [ ] Static Cards (Widgets): Total timed, total days using the application, logging in streak, average study time per session 
* [ ] Pie Chart: Hours spread out for each different course/class/subject
* [ ] Bar Chart: Hours spent on different assignments/tests, etc.
* [ ] Line Chart: The total time spent throughout the month (or year)
* [ ] Current rank, progress of milestone 
* [ ] Current calendar that contains all the deadlines or any scheduled studying sessions (should be interactive, can add dates and deadlines)
* [ ] Current progress towards a set goal (can select which one to view)

### Studying/Focus:

* [x] Create different tasks
* [x] Continue a current task
* [ ] Create a section to implement Google search 
* [x] Create a section to implement audio preferences (refer to music section)
* [x] Have a timer    
* [x] Create a section to allow for customizing the timer (sound, time, breaks, etc.)
* [ ] Create goals for separate courses/subjects
* [x] Create a section to take notes (not saved)
* [x] "Marathon" would be an automatic longer version of regular focus and be continuous, i.e. auto breaks.
* [ ] Add in option to allow browser only mode (after implementing Google search)

### Studying Analysis Tool: 

* [ ] This will be a page dedicated to other stuff or extra information that is cool to know but isn't really important (not included in the dashboard)
* [ ] Seeing the history of the studies (sorted/grouped by the different courses/subjects)
* [ ] See the next milestone/rank
* [ ] Using the user's data and trends, organize some tips that will pop up
* [ ] Seeing any noticeable/cool trends such as peak times or the subjects that were spent the most time on
* [ ] Using data, suggest some goals for the user (i.e. if studies for 5 hours, go for 6 hours or if a user neglects one of their subjects/course, suggest goals for that subject)

### To-Do:

* [ ] Create to-dos 
* [ ] Store to-dos
* [ ] Set deadlines (link with a calendar)
* [ ] Notify upcoming deadlines (alerts on page open)

### Music (Future update):

* [ ] When going out of the route (/video), play the video in a mini player
* [ ] Be allowed to select the different type of videos that the user wants to listen to when using the play video feature
* [ ] Embed a random video given the user's interest or a random one  

### Music:
* [x] Play music audio 
* [x] Skip forward/backward song/audio
* [x] Add preferences

### Milestone/Rank: 

* [ ] Track how long the user has logged in for 
* [ ] Track how many consecutive days (streak) the user has been logged in for
* Queries the different days and checks if they are back to back.
* [ ] Create a rank system for these data points (bronze, silver, etc.)
* Lose points for not accomplishing certain milestones
* [ ] Have medals/achievements for reaching certain points

### Settings/Preferences: 

* [ ] Open settings: (Enable/Disable leaving tab when timer is on) 

### Studying Habits (WIP):

* [ ] Try to promote healthy studying habits.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
